        <strong>History:</strong><br>
        Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) is the 7th entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following Grand Theft Auto IV (2008). Set in the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, the single-player story revolves around three protagonists: Michael De Santa, Franklin Clinton, and Trevor Phillips. They engage in heists while under pressure from corrupt government agents and powerful criminals. The game was released in 2013, becoming one of the most popular titles in the series.<br><br>

        <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
        The game world is navigated on foot and on vehicles, from either a first-person or a third-person perspective. Players control the protagonists through single-player and switch between them, both during and outside of missions. The story is based around the heist sequences, with many missions involving shooting and driving gameplay. A “wanted” system shows the aggression of police response towards players who commit crimes. In GTA Online (the game’s multiplayer mode), up to 30 players are able to interact in a variety of different co-op and competitive game modes.<br><br>

        <strong>Legacy:</strong><br>
        GTA V is the second best-selling game of all time with over 210 million copies shipped, and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in the first three. It was praised for its multiple-protagonist design, open world and gameplay. However, its depiction of violence and women caused controversies. Several gaming publications have awarded the game year-end awards including some Game of the Year awards. It is considered among the best video games ever made, and is one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time as well, earning over $8.5 billion in worldwide revenue. Its long anticipated successor, GTA VI, is set to be released in the fall of 2025.
