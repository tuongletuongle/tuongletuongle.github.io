          <strong>Gameplay:</strong><br> <!-- Gameplay heading -->
          It keeps the gameplay of previous Mario Kart games, with players controlling a character from the Mario universe in races around tracks. Tracks are themed around landmarks from the Super Mario series filled with power-ups that help players gain an advantage in races. Different difficulty levels are selectable before a race, and harder difficulties make the game go faster. In the new anti-gravity sequences, players have the ability to drive on walls and ceilings. Mario Kart 8 has a variety of singleplayer and local and online game modes, including Grand Prix racing and arena-based battle modes.<br><br> <!-- Gameplay details -->

          Mario Kart 8 is the fifth best-selling game of all time, with 75.81 million copies sold (if you combine the original and Deluxe versions). It was a massive success, with reviewers praising its gameplay and presentation. However, the battle mode was heavily criticized. Many critics praised the Deluxe version as the better version for its improved battle modes and overall nicer presentation. Both releases are praised as among the best of Mario Kart games, have won numerous awards, and, like the other games on this list, have been cited as among the greatest video games ever made. <!-- Legacy details -->
